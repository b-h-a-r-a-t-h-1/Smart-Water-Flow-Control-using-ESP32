# Smart-Water-Flow-Control-using-ESP32

Designed and developed an embedded application using the ESP32 microcontroller and Embedded C to monitor and control water flow for efficient utilization.
Integrated a NEMA stepper motor with driver circuitry to precisely regulate valve actuation based on real-time sensor feedback.
Implemented FreeRTOS for multitasking, enabling concurrent execution of tasks such as flow monitoring, motor control, user input handling, and fault detection.
Optimized system responsiveness and power efficiency by utilizing RTOS features like task prioritization, inter-task communication (queues/semaphores), and timer interrupts.
